**Basic Recipe Website:**
This project is a basic recipe website built using HTML. It serves as a platform for practicing and showcasing your HTML skills while creating a collection of your favorite recipes.

**Project Overview:**
The Basic Recipe Website project aims to provide a hands-on experience in structuring web pages using HTML. I will have the opportunity to utilize various HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links, to build a functional and visually appealing recipe website.


**By the end of this project I should be able to do the following:**
*Clone the repository to my local machine.
*Open the project in my preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
*Navigate to the main HTML file (index.html) and begin editing.

**I'll be adding the following features:**
*Display and categorize recipes using HTML elements.
+Add images and descriptions for each recipe.
*Include links to external sources or related pages.
*Customize the design using CSS for a personalized touch.
