    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul><b>Dough:</b>
        <p>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>⅓ cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 stick high-quality unsalted butter, fully softened, divided</li></p>
        
        <b>Sugar Syrup:</b>
        <p>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested in large strips (Optional)</li></p>
        
        <b>Custard Base:</b>
        <p>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (Optional)</li></ul></p>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, salt, and cold water in a bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon until dough just comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Dough should be sticky; adjust with more flour or water to achieve what's shown in the video.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough onto a well-floured surface. Dust a little more flour over the top. Knead for 1 to 2 minutes to form a round. Cover and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll dough into a square about 1/8-inch-thick, dusting with flour as necessary; dough should still be sticky.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 of the butter over 2/3 of the square using a silicone spatula, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Flip the unbuttered side over the middle of the square and fold the opposite end over it like a letter. Straighten the edges as needed.</li>
        </ol>
