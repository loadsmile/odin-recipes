    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Caldo verde is a popular soup in Portuguese cuisine. The basic traditional ingredients for caldo verde are finely shredded Portuguese cabbage or couve-galega, potatoes, olive oil, black pepper and salt, mainly flavoured with onion and garlic.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
          <li>1 medium onion, minced</li>
          <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
          <li>6 medium potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
          <li>2 quarts cold water</li>
          <li>6 ounces linguiça sausage, thinly sliced</li>
          <li>1 pound kale, rinsed and julienned</li>
          </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook for 3 minutes. Add potatoes and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Pour in water and bring to a boil; boil gently until potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook sausage in a large skillet over medium-low heat until it has released most of its fat, about 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Use an immersion blender to purée potato mixture. Stir in sausage and season with salt and pepper. Increase the heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in kale and simmer until tender and bright green, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
